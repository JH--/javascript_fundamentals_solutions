## Todo Exercise

For this assignment you will be combining your knowledge of DOM access and events to build a todo app!

As a user, you should be able to
- add a new todo (by submitting a form)
- mark a todo as completed (cross out the text)
- remove a todo

Make sure your application is styled - you can use bootstrap or your own css or both!
