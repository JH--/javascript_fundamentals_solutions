# Todo Exercise

For this assignment you will be combining your knowledge of DOM access and events to build a todo app!

## Part 1

As a user, you should be able to
- add a new todo (by submitting a form)
- mark a todo as completed (cross out the text of the todo)
- remove a todo

Make sure your application is styled - you can use bootstrap or your own css or both!

## Part 2:

Using localStorage, try to store your todos so that if you refresh the page - you do not lose what you have added to the list! As a bonus, try to also save todos that you have marked as complete!
