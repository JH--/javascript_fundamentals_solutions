## Recursion Exercise


- Write a function called `stringifyNumbers` which takes in an object and finds all of the values which are numbers and converts them to strings. Recursion would be a great way to solve this!

```javascript
var obj = {
    num: 1,
    data: {
        val: 4
    }
}
stringifyNumbers
```

- search through nested object to find data

- find a value in a string like "(())()()()()())"

- merge sort
