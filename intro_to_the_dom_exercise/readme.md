# Introduction to the DOM Exercise

## Part I 

Make sure you **DO NOT** delete/modify anything in the `index.html` file. Complete the following steps in the `script.js` file:

1. Add the necessary code to wait for the DOM to load to make sure that anything you manipulate in the DOM has loaded. You can do this either using `window.onload` or adding an event listener for `DOMContentLoaded`.

2. Replace the text "Change me" with "Hello World!"

3. When a user hovers over one of the colored boxes change the text to display the color that is being hovered over

4. Inside of the `section` create a new `div` element

5. Give your new `div` a class of `purple` and style it so that it has a background color of purple. 

6. Append your new `div` to the page

## Part II 

Create a racing game with the two cars. When the race button is pressed, the two cars should move across the screen until one of them is at the end. When the first block reaches the end - you should alert "winner!" As a bonus, turn this into a fun racing game!
