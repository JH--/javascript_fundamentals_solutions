# CSS Exercises

For these exercises - you will be rebuilding a few common websites to practice CSS. Although these exercises may seem tedious, there is NO better way than to rebuild existing sites. You might be tempted to just look at the source code - and that is fine for inspiration, but really try to do this yourself!

## Sites to rebuild

[https://www.google.com/](https://www.google.com/)

[https://www.wikipedia.org/](https://www.wikipedia.org/)

[https://www.yahoo.com/](https://www.yahoo.com/) - don't worry about images or what happens if you scroll down (and the navbar on the top shifting) - this is a good exercise in positioning
