## AJAX With jQuery Exercise

It's time to build something fun with your knowledge of jQuery and AJAX! Now that we have the ability to fetch data from remote servers - we can build so many different things! For this challenge you will be making use of one of the public APIs from the list [here](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis). Make sure the API **does not** require OAuth. 

Here are some ideas (you can build more than one!):

- A music app with the iTunes or Spotify API
- A movie search + info app using the OMDB API
- Endless GIFs with the Giphy API
- A card game using the Deck of Cards API
- A random Ron Swanson quote generator
- A fun word game with the Wordnik API
- A video search application using the YouTube API
- A Netflix suggestion with the Netflix Roulette API
- All the Pokemon or Starwars data you could ever want with the Pokeapi or SWAPI
